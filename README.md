# Drakerion-OCTGN-Plugin
A OCTGN Plugin for Drakerion TCG

Here you'll find :

- An open source fan made (with the kind support of the OCTGN community and Drakerion TCG team) code for the Drakerion Plugin for OCTGN
- A convenient executable that will install the OCTGN app and a dedicated launcher that will automatically install all image packs in your prefered language (French and English for now)
- .o8c image packs if you know how to and want to install your image packs manually (Games Manager -> Add Image Packs -> select your .o8c -> you're done, congrats !)

Please, fill free to fill up an issue Ticket if you have any question or suggestion about the plugin, I'll do my best to answer as soon as possible !

If you want to find other players and keep being updated on the best Dark Fantasy TCG to come, give a visit to https://.drakerion.com and come join us on the dedicated discord () !

Wish you the best time within and without the game, looking forward playing with you as well !
